To rebase your pull request to merge it into the develop branch instead of master, 
you'll need to follow a series of steps in your local Git environment. 
This involves changing the base of your current branch (feature/my-branch) from master to develop 
and then updating your pull request accordingly. Here's how you can do it step by step:

Step 1: Update Your Local Repository
Before starting the rebase process, make sure your local repository is up to date with all branches involved.
git checkout master
git pull origin master

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

Step 2: Checkout Your Feature Branch
git checkout feature/my-branch

Step 3: Rebase onto Develop
Now you will rebase your feature branch onto the develop branch. 
This will move all of your commits from feature/my-branch so they appear on top of the current end of develop

git rebase develop

During rebase, you might encounter conflicts. Git will pause the rebase and allow you to resolve the conflicts manually. 
After resolving any conflicts, use the following commands to continue the rebase:

git add .
git rebase --continue


Step 4: Force Push Your Changes
git push origin feature/my-branch --force
